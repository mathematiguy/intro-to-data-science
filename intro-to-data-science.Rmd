# What is Data Science?

## Data Science is:

From wikipedia:

> "Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms"

Data science can cover any or all of the following:

- Data visualisation
- Statistical modelling
- Machine learning
- Automation of data-related processes
- Big data/Distributed computing

## Multidisciplinary

```{r, out.height = "500px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/data-science-venn.png")
```

## Technical

```{r, out.height = "500px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/data-science-venn-2.png")
```

# Tools for Data Science

## Languages

- The most popular programming languages for data science are `Python` and `R`.
- Some flavour of `SQL` is also often necessary
- For big data, `Scala` is popular (but `Python`/`R` can do big data too)
- Learn `git`! Github is also awesome

If you want a recommendation, I'd say `Python` (but this is a matter of opinion).

```{r, out.height = "200px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-vs-python.jpg")
```

## In Python

In Python, the most common tools are these:

- `Anaconda` is the python distribution I use
- `Jupyter Notebooks`/`Jupyter Lab` is the IDE I use  
- For data manipulation, I use `pandas`
- For machine learning, I use `scikit-learn`
- For deep learning, I use `tensorflow` and `keras`
- For big data, I use `pyspark` or increasingly `dask`
- For data visualisation, I use `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `bokeh` or `plotly`

Also noteworthy: `scrapy` for web scraping, and `spacy` for natural language processing

# Machine Learning

## What is machine learning?

From wikipedia (edited):

> Machine learning is a sub-field of computer science and statistics which aims to give computers the ability to progressively improve performance on a specific task with data, without being explicitly programmed.

When it works, the idea is:

- Collect a lot of data about a problem
- Point an pattern finding algorithm at the data
- ...?
- Profit

<!-- Machine learning (or 'ML') is a quickly growing and diverse field. -->

<!-- At the cutting edge, things are changing fast, but older, popular techniques can still perform well on many problem domains. -->

## How does a machine learn?
